This repository will be a mosh posh of projects, files scripts that are owned by me to help me in my everyday life.
Each project has its own README detailing more steps, technical and high level, but this is an overview.


## Project 1: Customer Information Aggregation

Getting customer info is very valuable - many partners prevent us from doing so but we want 
to automate this from the order info to see if we can do more targeting here.

## Project 2: Google App Scripts

As a restaurant owner, there are many tasks that are manual and monotonous. Controlling
the inbox is one of them. There are informations about orders, business info, promos, and more.
While adding labels helps, doing something with those labels will be even better.
We automate creating responses via email to these emails, automate downloading important info,
automate adding labels as needed, and more to organize the life.


## Project 3: Automate Report Downloading

As a restaurant owner, there are many tasks that are manual and monotonous.
A big part of that is reporting. I always wanted to be a data driven business 
where the numbers support our business decisions but one of the biggest hinderances
to that is that fact that we have so many partnerships to derive orders from, but 
getting the info about them is difficult for us.
We need to get these reports in an automated fashion instead of manually downloading
as it takes too much time and too many errors. They don't generally have APIs making
it extra difficult to do something of this sort.
